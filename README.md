# burgerApp

burgerApp is a restaurant app that lets users select burgers they would like to eat. When a
user submits a burger name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page waiting
to be devoured. Each buger has a dollar sign button ($), when this button is cliced the burger
will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database whether 
it is devoured or not. 

The app uses the following technologies:
- MySQL,
- Node, 
- Express, 
- Handlebars, and 
- A homemade ORM.

Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the app, and handlebars are used to generate
the HTML.

This project is useful because it allows the developer to run JavaScript in the terminal
showing its versatility as a front and back end language as well as uses mySQL for 
database management as well as other technologies such as Handlebar templating.  


To get help with this project the user can refer to the documentation in npm and/or mySQL.
